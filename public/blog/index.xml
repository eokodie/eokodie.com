      <description>via GIPHYIn this post, I will explore the execution speed of various implementations of dataframe aggregation and combining operations in R.
I will record timings using microbenchmark, a package for measuring the performance of very small pieces of R code.</description>

This blog post is a walk-through of a function I wrote to make the process less painful.
A bit more backgroundWhen R developers create open source packages, they typically distribute them through The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), Github or, if the package concerns computational biology and/or bioinformatics, Bioconductor.</description>
