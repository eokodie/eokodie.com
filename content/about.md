My name is Ernest Omane-Kodie. I am at AXA where I use open-source technology, pricing and data science techniques to come up with answers to interesting questions around data. 

I have learned a lot from the amazing rstats community over the years. I started this blog as a way of giving back through musings on the R programming language, data and visualisation.
