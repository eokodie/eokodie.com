### ABOUT
My name is Ernest Omane-Kodie. I work at [Lloyds Banking Group](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ "Views expressed here are my own and do not represent the views of my employer") where I use open-source technologies, data engineering and data science techniques to come up with answers to interesting questions concerning data of all kinds.

I have learned a lot from the amazing rstats community over the years. I started this blog as a way of giving back, through musings on the R programming language, data and visualisation.
